        <h1>About Taste Test</h1>
        <p>Taste Test was created with the intent to reveal to users what</p>
        <p>their taste in music looks like in a graphical matter and present it in</p>
        <p>a customized playlist that will allow them to both see and hear their</p>
        <p>unique take on what constitutes beauty in the musical world. Originally,</p>
        <p>the heart of the application was going to be a neural network training </p>
        <p>algorithm that allowed us to leverage each individual user's Spotify history</p>
        <p>into useful training data. This data would be fed into our algorithm which would</p>
        <p>lead to a unique neural network modelled after the user's taste in music. Using</p>
        <p>this model, we could conceivalby run any given track on Spotify through it in order</p>
        <p>to determine how much the user would enjoy said track. Unfortunately, this plan was</p>
        <p>ultimately abandoned as the required amount of data needed to train each model was far</p>
        <p>beyond our reach.</p>
        <p>With this difficult decision, the Taste Team then pivoted towards a more genreal approach</p>
        <p>in which a large, intricate neural network would instead be trained against a corpus</p>
        <p>of Spotify's own music database in order to teach it how to analyze any track and determine</p>
        <p>its genre composition. The neural network itself is of the forward-feeding type, which</p>
        <p>which means the network lacks any sort of memory, solely relying on a type of linear</p>
        <p>regression and integral weight randomization to create a learned model. </p>
        <p>In essence, this model allows us to analyze any Spotify track and determine its similarity</p>
        <p>to a set of given generes.  With this information, we can simply calculate a user's genre</p>
        <p>preference composition with a realtively straightforward scoring algorithm and then</p>
        <p>run a corpus of tracks through the trained neural network in order to find the </p>
        <p>most optimal set of tracks for a user.</p>
